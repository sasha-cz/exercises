# exercises

Within this repository I am storing my code solutions for exercises that I solved. 

## How this Repo is organized

- First level directories represent the source of exercises, like 'hackerrank'.

- Second level directories represent the topic that the exercises are related to.

- Third level directories represent the actual exercises, organized into project folders. This is the most granular level, where the specific code solutions for each exercise are stored.
